# AI-Powered-Futuristic-Crowd-Staffing-Platform
AI-powered technologies screen hundreds of resumes to shortlist viable candidates, run skill tests, and rank candidate performance by the likelihood of success at work. They use data to provide insights that would take humans much longer to uncover. AI can even automatically schedule interviews with shortlisted candidates without the back-and-forth, and answer candidate queries through chatbots.   By leveraging the power of AI and ML, you’re freeing yourself up to concentrate on interviewing, negotiating, and more.
AI-powered hiring technology can do things like automate candidate sourcing to find viable candidates by pulling information from online job boards, talent pools, and social media. Instead of combing through candidate applications or profiles, AI technology uses your requirements to filter candidates so you’re served the top ones. This can mean open staffing requests take a shorter time to fill.

Other tools use sentiment analysis to analyze job descriptions, weeding out potentially biased language, therefore, attracting a more diverse pool of candidates. They can also give you an idea if the language you’re using is speaking to the right audience and industry.
